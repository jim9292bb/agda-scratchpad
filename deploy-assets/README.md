# deploy-assets

Tooling that prepares the static assets the browser app fetches at runtime:
ALS WASM binaries, library source archives, the per-module `.agdai` cache
under `static/agdai/`, and each library's own dependency manifest
(`static/agdai/<folderName>/agdai-manifest.json`) used to prefetch
`.agdai` files in parallel.

This is a clearly-separated subdirectory within this repo, not a standalone
package — and not a split-out-later candidate either: `src/lib/runtime/interface.ts`
imports `deploy-assets/generated-libraries.mjs` (and `../deploy.config.json`)
directly at build time, not just during CI, so this stays in the same repo as
the app it serves. See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) "Curated Multi-Library
Support" for the current plan to extend this to libraries beyond
stdlib/cubical/agda-categories — plfa, agda-unimath, 1lab.

## Deploying this project

1. `git clone` this repo.
2. Place the library and ALS files you need, **raw** (no zips), into
   `deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/` and `deploy-assets/als/` —
   see "What to place" below. `npm run auto-configure` does this step for this
   project's own shipped defaults (stdlib 2.3, cubical 0.9,
   agda-categories 0.3.0, ALS 2.8.0) — it downloads the same archives a
   self-deployer would, and extracts them into the same raw layout, so
   there's no separate mechanism, just an automated version of the same
   manual step.
3. Edit **`../deploy.config.json`** (repo root) to select which
   libraries/ALS versions to bundle. There's no separate library catalog to
   cross-reference any more — each profile's `libraries` entry (`{
   folderName, agdaLibFile, name?, version? }`) is everything this
   project's tooling needs structurally (see "Adding a library or ALS
   version" below).
4. `npm run setup` — verifies everything `deploy.config.json` needs is
   present, generates `deploy-assets/generated-libraries.mjs` from the
   real `.agda-lib` files you placed, then zips/copies everything into
   `static/` for serving.
5. `npm run check`
6. `npm run build`

For this project's own shipped defaults, steps 2–6 collapse to:

```sh
npm run auto-configure && npm run setup && npm run check && npm run build
```

### What to place

```
deploy-assets/
  library/
    <folderName>/                    # see notes below
      <agdaLibFile>                  # at whatever depth the library uses
      src/...                        # raw .agda source
      _build/<numeric agda version>/agda/...   # optional, see notes below
      agdai-manifest.json            # optional, see notes below
  als/
    <version>/                       # see notes below
      <wasmFilename>                 # a single binary file
      agda-data/                     # required, see notes below
        Agda/Builtin/*.agda
        agda-builtins.agda-lib
        _build/<numeric agda version>/agda/Agda/Builtin/*.agdai
```

No zips anywhere in `deploy-assets/` — `npm run setup` is what zips a
library's source tree (and `agda-data/`) into the zips the browser fetches
at runtime, and copies a `_build/` tree as-is into `static/agdai/<folderName>/`
(those are served flat, one `.agdai` file per request, never as a zip).
Both `deploy-assets/library/` and `deploy-assets/als/` are gitignored;
nothing in them is committed.

**`deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/`** — `folderName` is whatever you
set it to in `deploy.config.json` — e.g. `stdlib-2.3/`, `cubical-0.9/`,
`agda-categories-0.3.0/`. Naming it `<name>-<version>` is just a
convention, not a requirement — it can be anything; including a version
string lets two versions of the same library be placed side by side (see
ROADMAP.md "Curated Multi-Library Support").

**`deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/_build/<numeric agda version>/agda/...`**
— optional raw prebuilt `.agdai` files. The subdirectory name must
exactly match the numeric Agda version of whatever ALS build will run
against it (parsed live from that build's own `--version` output, not
declared anywhere). To produce this yourself: `cd` into this library's
own root (where its `.agda-lib` lives) and run native
`agda --build-library` — writes the `_build/` tree here directly, no
separate collection step. If it `depend:`s on another library (e.g.
agda-categories on standard-library), register that other library first
via a library-file: a plain text file with one line per
*currently-selected* library (`deploy.config.json`), each the absolute
path to `deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/<agdaLibFile>` (look up
`folderName`/`agdaLibFile` in `deploy.config.json`), passed to
`--build-library` as `--library-file=<path to that file>`; confirmed
empirically that a library with no `depend:` (e.g. cubical) needs no
`--library-file=` at all.

If your native `agda` predates 2.8.0 (no `--build-library`), use
`node deploy-assets/build-agdai-cache.mjs --library <folderName> [--agda-bin <path>]`
instead — run `generate-manifest.mjs` for that library first if you
haven't already, since this reads its `agdai-manifest.json`. The
optional `--agda-bin` flag defaults to the `agda` on your PATH; pass
the full path to a specific binary if you have multiple Agda versions
installed (the version used determines the `_build/<version>/`
subdirectory name, so it must match the `alsVersion` you are targeting). It drives
one `agda --interaction-json` session and sends a `Cmd_load` for each
"source vertex" of the dependency graph (a module nothing else in the
library imports — provably both necessary, since nothing else will ever
reach it, and sufficient, since the graph is a DAG so every module is
reachable from some source vertex), letting everything else get loaded
and cached as a side effect. Confirmed empirically on the real stdlib
(333 source vertices covering all 1153 modules): takes about the same
time as `--build-library` itself (~480s vs. ~456s) and produces the
exact same `_build/` tree, with no `Everything.agda`/option-conflict
problem to work around (each `Cmd_load` is an independent top-level
module — no combined entry point is ever written).

**`deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/agdai-manifest.json`** — optional,
this library's own dependency graph; see "Regenerating the dependency
graph" below.

**`deploy-assets/als/<version>/`** — unlike a library's `folderName` (any
name you like), this one must be byte-for-byte identical to that
version's `alsVersion` in `deploy.config.json` — it's used directly as a
lookup path (`deploy-assets/build-static-assets.mjs`,
`print-required-files.mjs`), not just a label. A mismatch (e.g. `"2.8"`
here vs `"2.8.0"` in `deploy.config.json`) means `npm run setup` reports
the wasm/`agda-data` as `MISSING` even though you placed them. `npm run
setup` also actually runs the wasm with `--version` to confirm the file
inside genuinely is that build, not just correctly named. Each version
gets its own directory rather than sharing one flat `als/` because
`agda-data/`'s primitive source files (below) aren't safely
interchangeable across versions: a newer compiler's primitive sources can
use syntax/BUILTINs an older compiler doesn't recognize.

**`deploy-assets/als/<version>/agda-data/`** — raw extracted Agda builtin
data, required for every ALS version (`npm run setup` refuses to proceed
without it) — there's no optional "run without prebuilt builtin data"
mode. Two halves: `Agda/Builtin/*.agda` is primitive source that ships
with the Agda compiler itself; `_build/<numeric agda version>/agda/...`
is a precompiled interface cache for those same primitives, safe to
share across versions even without the per-version directory above —
already namespaced by its own version subpath, same as a library's own
`_build/`, so a mismatched ALS version simply won't find it and
recompiles from the source half instead.

To get it: it's just `lib/prim/` from wherever your **native** `agda`
binary (matching the ALS version you're placing it for) keeps its own
bundled data — find it with `agda --print-agda-dir`, then it's
`<that path>/lib/prim/`. The `_build/<version>/` cache inside isn't
something you build with a separate command — confirmed empirically (by
comparing file timestamps): it's generated automatically, in place, the
first time that `agda` binary type-checks *anything* that transitively
uses Agda's builtins (which is effectively everything, including any of
this project's own libraries). If you've already run native `agda` once
for any reason (e.g. to produce a library's own prebuilt `.agdai` cache,
above), the prim cache is already sitting there — just copy the whole
`lib/prim/` directory over. If not, run `agda` against any trivial file
first (even one that just declares `module M where`), then copy.

Neither libraries nor ALS versions have a separate catalog file to
cross-reference any more — every profile's own fields in
`deploy.config.json` are already everything this project's tooling needs
structurally (see "`deploy.config.json` schema" below). There is no
"fill in a URL" option anywhere in this project — nothing here says where
to download anything from. `npm run auto-configure` is the one
exception, and it's deliberately narrow: a hardcoded script that fetches
only the exact files this project's own shipped defaults need. It
doesn't read `deploy.config.json` — adding your own library/ALS version
gets you nothing from it. See `deploy-assets/auto-configure.mjs`'s own
header comment.

### `deploy.config.json` schema

`deploy.config.json` (repo root) is plain JSON — no comment syntax, so the
full field docs live here instead of inline in the file itself. Default
reproduces this project's own deployment (ALS 2.8.0 with Standard
Library v2.3 + Cubical v0.9) unchanged.

Schema: a flat list of `profiles`. Each profile is a complete,
ready-to-use combination — one ALS/Agda version plus the library set that
goes with it. There is deliberately no separate "pick an ALS version" +
"pick a library set" pair of independent choices: every option in
`profiles` is valid by construction, so the UI only needs a single
profile selector (shown below the ALS status card when more than one
profile is configured) and can never present an incompatible pairing.

- `id`, `label`: identify the profile in the profile selector / local storage.
- `alsVersion`, `wasmFilename`: which ALS build this profile uses — this
  *is* the ALS catalog now, there's no separate file to cross-reference.
  If the same `alsVersion` is referenced from more than one profile,
  every reference must agree on `wasmFilename` (it's the same build, not
  a second one).
- `libraries`: a list of `{ folderName, agdaLibFile, name?, version? }` —
  this *is* the library catalog now, there's no separate file to
  cross-reference:
  - `folderName` (required): the directory name under
    `deploy-assets/library/` — also this library's identity for every
    internal purpose (cache keys, asset paths, VFS folder name). Must be
    unique; if the same `folderName` is referenced from more than one
    profile, every reference must agree on `agdaLibFile`/`name`/`version`
    (it's the same library, not a second one).
  - `agdaLibFile` (required): the `.agda-lib` filename at that library's
    root. `npm run setup` reads this file directly to learn its
    `include:`/`name:` (written to `deploy-assets/generated-libraries.mjs`
    — see "What `npm run setup` generates" below) — neither is
    hand-maintained here, so they can't drift from the real file.
  - `name`, `version` (optional): cosmetic only (e.g. shown in the UI) —
    nothing reads these to build a path or a cache key.

You are responsible for verifying that the libraries within one profile
are actually compatible with each other (same underlying type theory —
e.g. don't mix a Cubical library with a non-Cubical one — and no
conflicting transitive version requirements, e.g. two different stdlib
versions) and that they work with the chosen `alsVersion`. Nothing here
checks this automatically. See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) "Curated
Multi-Library Support" for context and known compatibility concerns
between candidate libraries (agda-categories, plfa, agda-unimath, 1lab).

### Adding a library or ALS version

1. Add a `{ folderName, agdaLibFile, name?, version? }` entry directly to
   a `deploy.config.json` profile's `libraries` — there's no separate
   library catalog file to add an entry to first. (For a new ALS version,
   set that profile's `alsVersion`/`wasmFilename` directly the same way —
   no separate ALS catalog file either.) `folderName` and `agdaLibFile`
   are required; `name`/`version` are optional and purely cosmetic (e.g.
   shown in the UI) — nothing reads them to build a path or a cache key.
2. If the library `depend:`s on another configured library (e.g.
   agda-categories depends on `standard-library-2.3`), the browser
   runtime registers every selected library together automatically, so
   `depend:` resolves at runtime with no extra step — `libraryName` (the
   exact `name:` declared inside the library's own `.agda-lib`, which is
   what `depend:` actually matches against) is read directly from that
   file by `npm run setup`, not hand-declared anywhere in this project.
   Regenerating the dependency graph (below) needs no extra step either —
   `generate-manifest.mjs` extracts each module's own `import` targets by
   name, whichever library they happen to belong to.
3. Place the library's raw source (or the ALS's wasm/`agda-data/`) under
   `deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/` or `deploy-assets/als/` by
   hand, then run `npm run setup` (this is also what generates
   `deploy-assets/generated-libraries.mjs` — see "What `npm run setup`
   generates" below).
4. Regenerate the dependency graph (below) if you want prefetching for it.

Check [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) before adding plfa/agda-unimath/1lab — their exact
`.agda-lib` layout and type-theory compatibility with existing entries
hasn't been confirmed yet.

### What `npm run setup` generates

`deploy-assets/generate-library-info.mjs` reads every selected library's
real `deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/<agdaLibFile>` directly and
writes `deploy-assets/generated-libraries.mjs`, mapping each `folderName`
to the `includeSubpath`/`libraryName` parsed straight out of that file's
`include:`/`name:` lines. `src/lib/runtime/interface.ts` imports this
generated file at build time (Vite inlines it into the compiled bundle —
no extra runtime fetch). Nothing hand-declares `includeSubpath`/
`libraryName` anywhere in this project any more, so they can never drift
from what the real file says.

This generated file is gitignored (depends on `deploy-assets/library/`,
which is itself gitignored) — `npm run setup` always regenerates it. It's
also regenerated as a `predev`/`precheck`/`prebuild` step (see
`package.json`) so `npm run check`/`npm run build`/`npm run dev` never
hard-fail just because `deploy-assets/library/` hasn't been populated yet
(e.g. CI's fast `check-and-build` job deliberately skips
`auto-configure`/`setup` — a library whose `.agda-lib` isn't there yet is
just skipped with a warning in that case, not an error; the resulting
empty/partial file is enough for the build to type-check and compile,
since `src/routes/+layout.js` sets `ssr = false`, so the actual
`GENERATED_LIBRARY_INFO` content is only read once a real browser session
runs the app — by which point a real deployment has always run `npm run
setup` for real). `npm run setup` itself stays strict: it only ever
reaches `generate-library-info.mjs` after
`deploy-assets/print-required-files.mjs` has confirmed every required
`.agda-lib` genuinely exists, so nothing is silently skipped in that path.

Each ALS version's own prebuilt `.agdai` cache version is no longer
declared anywhere either (the old `agdaiCacheVersion` catalog field is
gone) — `src/lib/agda/prefetch.js` asks the running ALS itself, live, for
its numeric Agda version (`src/lib/worker/als-wasi-shim.ts`'s
`getNumericAgdaVersion()`), and uses that to build the
`_build/<version>/` prefetch path. (There's no `--numeric-version` flag
on `als` itself — confirmed empirically, it's not one of the few options
`als --help` lists, and isn't forwarded to the underlying Agda library
either; `getNumericAgdaVersion()` parses the version number straight out
of `als`'s own `--version` output instead, which *is* a real flag.) This
means a placed `_build/` cache only ever gets used if its subdirectory
name matches the *actual* running Agda version exactly — no possibility
of a hand-typed version guess drifting from reality. A mismatch (or no
`_build/` at all) just means a slower from-source recompile instead of a
cache hit, never an error.

### Regenerating the dependency graph

Each library has its own dependency graph
(`deploy-assets/library/<folderName>/agdai-manifest.json`, copied to
`static/agdai/<folderName>/agdai-manifest.json` by `npm run setup`) — never one
combined file. A session only ever loads the graphs for its active
profile's libraries, so adding a library later never touches an existing
one's manifest. These are never auto-fetched for libraries/ALS versions
you've added or changed — `npm run auto-configure` only ever supplies
this project's own shipped default graphs.

```sh
node deploy-assets/generate-manifest.mjs --library <folderName>
```

That's the whole process — no `Everything.agda` to hand-write, no shared
library-file, no native `--dependency-graph` run. For every file under
the library's own `.agda-lib` `include:` (any extension `agda` itself
recognizes — `.agda` and every literate variant), this spawns
`agda --interaction-json` and asks it for `Cmd_tokenHighlighting`: a
real Agda interaction command that returns purely lexical token
highlighting for that one file *without* loading, resolving, or
type-checking any of its imports (confirmed: it works even when an
imported module doesn't exist). Every highlighted range that isn't a
`keyword` — comments (including nested ones), literate prose/code-fence
markup, symbols, holes, pragma bodies, string/number literals — gets
replaced with a single space; matching `\bimport\b\s*(\S+)\s` against
what's left correctly extracts that file's own direct import targets,
immune to every edge case found while building this (multi-line
`import`, a comment sitting between `import` and the module name with
zero surrounding whitespace, semicolon-glued declarations, literate
prose that happens to contain text shaped like an import statement).
Requires a **native** `agda` binary on `PATH` (not the WASM build) —
same prerequisite as before, just no other setup. Runs at
`os.cpus().length`-way parallelism; regenerating all of stdlib (1153
files) takes about 10 seconds.

This relies on `--interaction-json` (introduced in Agda 2.6.1 — won't
work at all on older versions) and parses its `Cmd_tokenHighlighting`
JSON response's `payload`/`atoms`/`range` fields. That JSON API has had
real breaking changes between versions before (e.g. 2.6.2 changed how
errors/warnings are represented) and Agda makes no documented stability
promise about it, though no change to the specific fields this script
reads has been found in any release notes from 2.6.0 through 2.8.0. Run
the native `agda` you actually intend to deploy with (matching this
project's `alsVersion`) — same versioning caveat as everything else
that shells out to native `agda` in this file.

There's no `--no-options`/option-conflict problem to work around either
(unlike the old `Everything.agda` approach, which had to split
`agda-categories` across multiple files because no single
`{-# OPTIONS #-}` line satisfies every one of its modules) — each file
is scanned on its own, never combined into one synthetic entry point.

This is strictly more complete than the old `--dependency-graph`-based
graph, not just simpler: confirmed by reproducing this project's
previously-shipped manifests exactly — applying standard transitive
reduction to the new tool's output reproduces the old file edge-for-edge
for all three of this project's libraries. The old approach was
silently dropping real direct edges, because `agda --dependency-graph`'s
Dot backend applies a transitive reduction (for graph-visualization
purposes) that this project's old pipeline took as the manifest's
source of truth. `prefetch.js`'s `collectDeps` only does a transitive-
closure walk, so the extra edges this script keeps don't change
prefetch behavior (closure is invariant under transitive reduction) —
they just make each module's own edge list accurate.

This project's own shipped graphs (for stdlib, cubical, and
agda-categories) are produced this same way by a maintainer and uploaded
to the `cache-2.8.0` GitHub Release alongside the other prebuilt assets,
where `npm run auto-configure` downloads them from — independently per
library, so a missing one only disables prefetching for that library.

## Reference

### Catalogs

Neither libraries nor ALS versions have a catalog file any more —
`deploy.config.json`'s own profile fields are already everything this
project's tooling needs structurally; see "`deploy.config.json` schema"
above.

- **`resolve-deploy-config.mjs`** — resolves `deploy.config.json`,
  validating every reference up front (a typo, or a folderName/alsVersion
  referenced with two conflicting specs across profiles, fails fast with
  a clear error). Exports `getSelectedLibraries()` and
  `getSelectedAlsVersions()` — deduplicated across all configured
  profiles — used by the scripts below instead of reading
  `deploy.config.json` directly.
- **`agda-lib-utils.mjs`** — tiny shared parsers for raw `.agda-lib` file
  content (`include:`/`name:`), no `agda` binary needed. Used by both
  `generate-library-info.mjs` and `generate-manifest.mjs`.

### Scripts

- **`print-required-files.mjs`** — checks `deploy-assets/{library,als}/` for
  everything the currently-configured `deploy.config.json` needs (files and
  directories), printing `MISSING: ...` lines and exiting non-zero if
  anything required is absent. Also actually runs each placed `als` wasm
  with `--version` (via `run-als-version.mjs`) to confirm it reports
  itself as the `alsVersion` it's configured under — printing
  `MISMATCH: ...` if not, since the directory name alone is just a string
  you typed and doesn't guarantee the wasm file inside is actually that
  build. Run automatically by `npm run setup` before it builds `static/`.
- **`run-als-version.mjs`** — runs a given `als` wasm path with `--version`
  via Node's built-in WASI and prints its stdout verbatim. Always invoked
  as a child process (by `print-required-files.mjs`), never imported —
  Node's WASI implementation writes directly to the real stdout file
  descriptor, bypassing `process.stdout.write`, so only a parent process
  piping this one's actual stdout can capture it.
- **`generate-library-info.mjs`** — generates
  `deploy-assets/generated-libraries.mjs` from the real `.agda-lib` files
  in `deploy-assets/library/` — see "What `npm run setup` generates"
  above. Run automatically by `npm run setup`, and also as a
  `predev`/`precheck`/`prebuild` step (`package.json`).
- **`build-static-assets.mjs`** — zips each selected library's raw source
  into `static/library/<folderName>.zip`, copies a placed `_build/` tree
  and `agdai-manifest.json` into `static/agdai/<folderName>/`, copies each
  selected ALS version's wasm, and zips its `agda-data/` into
  `static/als/<version>/agda-data.zip`. Runs automatically as part of
  `npm run setup`.
- **`generate-manifest.mjs`** — generates a library's dependency-graph
  manifest directly from its own placed source tree, via
  `agda --interaction-json`'s `Cmd_tokenHighlighting` — see "Regenerating
  the dependency graph" above.
- **`build-agdai-cache.mjs`** — fallback for producing a library's
  `_build/` `.agdai` cache on a native `agda` older than 2.8.0 (no
  `--build-library`) — see "What to place" above. Reads the
  `agdai-manifest.json` `generate-manifest.mjs` already produced.
- **`auto-configure.mjs`** — fetches and extracts this project's own
  shipped default library/ALS files into the raw layout. Hardcoded, not
  catalog-driven — see its own header comment.
- **`zip-utils.mjs`** — shared minimal ZIP extraction/creation helpers (no
  external dependency) used by the scripts above.

## How the manifest is used at runtime

`generate-manifest.mjs` (see "Regenerating the dependency graph" above)
asks `agda --interaction-json` for each of a library's own files' direct
`import` targets and writes one `{ graph }` per library, keyed by
module name, each value the list of modules it directly imports — the
full direct-edge graph, not transitively reduced. At runtime,
`src/lib/agda/prefetch.js` loads every active-profile library's manifest,
merges them into one working graph (deriving which library owns each
module from which file it came from — there's no `libOf` field in the
files themselves), computes the transitive closure from the user's
`import` statements, and triggers parallel fetches.
